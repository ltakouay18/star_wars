# star_wars

In this project I am analyzing Star Wars movies data to determine which film, according to Americans is the best of the franchise.
***
I will be using star_wars.csv file, but will focus on 8 relevant columns:

* RespondentID — An anonymized ID for the respondent (person taking the survey)
* Gender — the respondent's gender
* Age — the respondent's age
* Household Income — the respondent's income
* Education — the respondent's education level
* Location (Census Region) — the respondent's location
* Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise? — a Yes or No response
* Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise? — a Yes or No response
